## About Me

I am a highly accomplished and results-driven Senior Site Reliability & Platform Engineer with over 8 years of experience architecting scalable cloud-native systems and leading high-performing engineering teams. My expertise spans Kubernetes, AWS infrastructure automation, and GenAI/ML platform reliability. I have a proven track record of maintaining 99.99% service availability, significantly reducing Change Failure Rate (CFR) by 60%, and accelerating deployment velocity for over 100 engineering teams. I possess deep expertise in observability, incident response, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and applying robust software engineering principles to achieve operational excellence.

## Professional Experience

### LinkedIn
**Senior Site Reliability & Platform Engineer** | June 2022 - Present | Sunnyvale, CA

*   **Architected and owned the Automated Stability Guard** from concept to production MVP in 4 weeks, implementing SLI and SLO framework and error budget management that maintained **99.99% service availability** while reducing Change Failure Rate by **60%**, from 50 to under 20 SEVs per 10k deployments.
*   **Designed and delivered a GenAI-powered Go/gRPC incident detection platform**, building microservices and APIs that drove a **40% MTTD reduction** for production threats via automated, real-time observability dashboards.
*   **Led end-to-end software delivery of a unified test platform** using Playwright and GitOps automation, creating a self-service Internal Developer Platform (IDP) that **improved release velocity for more than 100 teams** by providing standardized golden path templates for CI/CD and accelerating feature development.
*   **Defined the 18-month technical roadmap** for platform reliability, securing senior leadership buy-in to invest in initiatives that improved infrastructure scalability and observability company-wide.
*   **Architected and shipped RESTful APIs and microservices** for key platform features, collaborating with product teams to deliver new functionality for 50M+ daily users.

### Amazon Lab126 Inc.
**System Development Engineer** | Nov 2020 - June 2022 | Sunnyvale, CA

*   **Owned the architectural migration** of a monolithic Java system to a microservices platform, ensuring a **99.99% availability SLO** was maintained post-launch through a comprehensive observability framework and automated monitoring.
*   **Engineered an internal developer platform** by developing and maintaining core Java and Python microservices, which **reduced new pipeline onboarding from 8 weeks to 4 weeks** through self-service infrastructure automation and standardized deployment patterns.
*   **Implemented SLI and SLO frameworks** with automated alerting and incident response procedures, establishing platform reliability standards that became the blueprint for all new distributed infrastructure operations.

### Amazon Web Services
**Platform and Reliability Engineer** | Jan 2020 - Nov 2020 | Dallas, TX

*   **Accelerated platform adoption** for thousands of internal AWS developers by architecting high-level Python SDK abstractions, **reducing infrastructure complexity and development cycle time**.
*   **Designed and shipped new API features and automation tools** as part of the internal developer experience team, supporting both reliability and product velocity goals.
*   **Enhanced service availability** across AWS infrastructure by engineering proactive client-side IAM validation for the internal S3 client, **eliminating an entire class of permission-related runtime errors**.
